1. I have completed the survey.
2. 
   (a) I think each circle is labeled with a unique binary code with 2 bit, and their overlap is labeled with the sum of the two labels.<br>
   (b) ![Image](1.jpeg)<br>
   (c) ![Image](2.jpeg)<br>
   (d) There are 2 codes (1010, 0101) missing from the Venn diagram with 4 circles. Since there are 14 regions including the region outside, and there are 16 unique 4-bit binary strings, there should be 16 regions including the region outside in order to have each 4-bit binary string used exactly once.
